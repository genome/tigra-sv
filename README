Building/Testing
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CMake is used. CMakeLists.txt are used to generate Makefiles. Look at
them and understand how to add source code etc.

To compile and link, run:
    cmake .
    make

To run unit tests, run:
    ctest 
        or
    ctest -V (for verbose output)

To run integration tests, from the integration-test directory and run:
    ur test run --recurse
